src-musl
========

A musl build environment

This is a public domain set of scripts to bootstrap an environment for 
cross-compiling musl.  It should allow:
-easy and extensive configuration of sources and options (see control.env)
-builds from git (done) with arbitrary tag selection (not started)
-patched builds from tarball, preferably with the ability to make patches 
	from sed scripts (not yet included)
-local source trees
